Implement a ComboBox control (like a dropdown list)
The ComboBox holds a set of items (an array)
Initially only a single item, the selected item, is visible (the ComboBox is collapsed)
When the selected item is clicked, all other items are shown (the ComboBox is expanded)
If an item is clicked, it becomes the selected item and the ComboBox collapses
Each of the items in a ComboBox can contain any valid HTML code
Use RequireJS and handlebars.js
jQuery is not obligatory (use it if you will)
